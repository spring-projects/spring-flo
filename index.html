{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Flo is a JavaScript library that offers a basic embeddable HTML5 visual builder for pipelines 
and simple graphs. This library is used as the basis of the stream builder in [Spring Cloud Data Flow](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/)
and [Spring XD](http://projects.spring.io/spring-xd/).

{% capture main_content %}

Flo includes all the basic elements of an integration-flow designer such as connectors, 
control nodes, palettes, state transitions, and graph topologies—importantly, there is a textual 
shell, DSL support, and a graphical canvas designed for creating and reviewing comprehensive 
workflows.

## Features

* Create, manage, and monitor stream pipelines using DSL, a graphical canvas, or both
* Write pipelines via DSL with content-assist and auto-complete
* See a visual representation of modules across a distributed deployment
* Use auto-adjustment and grid-layout capabilities in the GUI for easier and more efficient 
organization of pipelines
